# Report, understand and prioritize unmet needs

How do we process unmet needs \(problems\) **reported by users that are not yet satisfied by the platform?**

### **1- Needs collection and understanding**

When a need that is not currently satisfied by the software is reported by a user, the user can record a new item in our [wishlist repository](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/wishlist). A template is displayed to guide you in how to report the need.

Most of the time, the reporter of the need will not have all info when they start the discussion about this new need. When discussions move on, the curators of the discussion will update the main post to always keep the up-to-date specification of the need. Some candidates might appear and one option might be quickly chosen in the discussion. 

**WARNINGS:** Users will tend to express their needs as solutions or features \("I would like a new button here that will let me do this thing..."\) and won't explain clearly the need behind it \("I'm having trouble finding this thing and it's one of the most frequent things I do"\). It is the responsability of the local instance product owner to understand the underlying need, and express that need in a structured way, before starting to brainstorm potential solutions.

### **2- Needs priorization**

Lots of OFN users in different countries have different needs. So how to decide which need we address first?

Each instance will have their way to discuss with their users and decide together with them what are the top priorities for that instance. We have experimented voting on feature but this process did not really lead to spot the features that we really needed to do first.  
**We are currently reviewing this system.**

The current prioritized pipe can then be seen in Github but also in our community forum. Once a week the delivery circle will issue notes that keep everyone updated of where things are.

### 3- About "emergency needs"

Some users sometimes express their need as an "emergency need". We invite instance managers to question why it is an emergency. **In OFN we consider as emergencies only bug severity 1 and 2 that really prevent users to use the platform**. For a new need not yet satisfied, if you do consider it an emergency, you can create a topic on our community forum to discuss it.
