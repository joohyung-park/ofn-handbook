# Report and curate bugs

There is no software without bugs. We just need a process to report and fix bugs efficiently. Not all bugs are equivalent, some really prevent the use of the platform and should be addressed as soon as possible. Others are small bugs that are not really annoying, we can live with them, users may not even have noticed them.

### **1- What is a bug?**

We regularly have people opening issues on Github saying they are bug, but in fact they talk about a new feature not yet implemented. Bugs are only gaps between how a feature is supposed to work ALREADY, and how it works ACTUALLY.

### **2- What to do if you identify a bug?**

Open an issue on Github. When you create an issue, you will see a default template guiding you to report that bug. We have worked on a [five level priority list](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki/Bug-severity), please always affect a priority level to a bug, that will help us curate them! 

### **3- How do we curate bugs?**

The train drivers of the OFN will treat the new bugs the following way:  
a- Every new bug is added to the "Bug backlog" visible on the zenhub view and prioritized on a lazy consent mode. This can also be done by the person who reports the bug.  
b- The product owners and train driver will make sure the solution is clear enough. If an inception is needed to clarify the job to be done, they will ensure it is done.   
c- The train driver will make sure that 5 bugs are always prioritized in the delivery pipe \(dev ready column\) and will ensure bugs are regularly worked on.  
d- For s1 or s2 bugs \(most severe bugs\), as soon as the bug is reported, they will add a mesage on the \#dev channel on Slack to make sure the first developer available work on it as soon as possible and will be put at the top of the dev-ready column.
