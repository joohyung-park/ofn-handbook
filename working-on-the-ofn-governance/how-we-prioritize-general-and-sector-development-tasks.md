# How we prioritize general & sector development tasks

The OFN requires a lot of day to day operations to make the project work, like facilitation, documentation, onboarding actions, communication, networking, etc.

Also, as explained before, we build not only technical open source resources \(the OFN software\) but also sector development resources. To do that we also have a team starting to getting better organized to collaborate, prioritize, document and share sector development resources.

These tasks require other skills than the dev skills required to develop a software of course :-\) But we all work together as the tools and knowledge are closely linked: when talking to users who think they need a tool to improve their efficiency, we sometime realize that their main issue might be somewhere else. So both work hand in hand.
