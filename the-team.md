# The team

As we explain later in this guidebook, people can contribute on the local level \(facilitating a local OFN community\) or at global level. At global level, we are building a team of certified contributors, who have gone through the [onboarding process](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbook.io/ofn-handbook/working-on-the-ofn-governance/team-organization/onboarding-process) \(most of them were there before this process was even built actually!\). Some are paid contributors, others can afford and have chosen to remain volunteer contributors, but all people in the certified team are involved on a daily basis.

You can access a list of our current certified contributors on [our main website](https://www.openfoodnetwork.org/who-we-are/).

Feel free to contact them on [Slack](https://openfoodnetwork.slack.com) or through the [community forum](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org)!
